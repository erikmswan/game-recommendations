# Game recommendations:

## Story-driven first person
- Bioshock Infinite (Singleplayer)
    - Unravel the secrets of a colonial America themed flying city. Story gets absolutely nuts.
- Prey (Singleplayer)
    - Survive and discover secrets in a space station where aliens called "mimics" that can turn into any item in the environment hunt you.
- Portal 2 (Single/Multiplayer)
    - The classic first-person puzzle game, absolutely hilarious writing with the perennial character of GladOS and featuring Stephen Merchant as a sarcastic flying robot sidekick.
- Call of Cthulhu (Singleplayer)
    - Decent enough lovecraftian horror, choice-driven gameplay with light detective elements. Scratches that Cosmic Horror itch.
- What Remains of Edith Finch (Singleplayer)
    - A wonderful experience, perfect for playing with a partner. This game was such a delight. There is no combat, just digging into the family of Edith Finch by exploring her childhood home and progressing through innovative story pieces. Very sad at parts.
- The Vanishing of Ethan Carter (Singleplayer)
    - A full logical deduction game. Absolutely stunning graphics, however there are no people you interact with, you explore the environment to solve mysteries and experience existential pontifications.

## Third person sandbox
- GTA V (Single/Multiplayer)
    - Amazing in scope and detail. If you haven't played this yet, you really should.
- Red Dead Redemption 2 (Single/Multiplayer)
    - Actually Living in the Wild West simulator, this game is an achievement in so many ways. Try it.
- The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt (Singleplayer)
    - Developed by a Czech company based on a Polish book, The Witcher 3 rules. The graphics are gorgeous and the story is so engaging they made a TV series from it. Geralt is such a likeable character. The game always keeps it fresh. A higher learning curve than normal. Can't recommend this enough.
- Subnautica (Singleplayer)
    - One of my favorite games of all time, it helped me overcome my thalassaphobia. Nothing is scarier than swimming in the ocean at night only to hear the roar of a Reaper. Build underwater bases, control vehicles large and small and discover alien secrets when you become stranded on an alien world.
- Batman: Arkham Knight (Singleplayer)
    - I only played Arkham Asylum and some of Arkham City, but might as well try the new one. These Batman games (minus Origins) are solid and make you feel like Batman.
- Middle Earth: Shadow of War (Singleplayer)
    - Innovative "Nemesis" system that makes it fun to recruit an orc army and conquer orc strongholds. Epic in scope. It's total shlock and Tolkien would have hated but I love it.
- Mad Max (Singleplayer)
    - Great driving mechanics, decent combat and wonderful environment/level design. Gets repetitive but still worth playing.
- Sleeping Dogs (Singleplayer)
    - Set in China, it has an interesting story and good open-world gameplay.
- Kerbal Space Program (Singleplayer)
    - Build rockets with realistic physics and explore a 1/10 scale solar system. For a certain kind of person, this is as good as it gets. You have to learn real orbital mechanics to succeed. Make sure you have enough fuel to get into orbit, then start your burn before the apoapsis by dividing your delta V in half. It is what you make it.
- Space Engineers (Single/Multiplayer)
    - Like Kerbal legos. Extremely deep. Admittedly, I haven't even scratched the surface on thsi one.
- Watch_Dogs 2 (Singleplayer)
    - GTA V but with hackers. Cheesy as all get out, but it has its charm. Drive around the bay area and hack shit.

## Third person action
- Devil May Cry 3 & 5 (Singleplayer)
    - Devil May Cry 3 is a classic that I grew up with -- one of the best of the series. A ridiculously over the top action hero, half-demon Dante is a mercenary that hunts other demons. Devil May Cry 5 is the very worth successor and has the best action game thrills around.
- Bayonetta (Singleplayer)
    - A spiritual successor to DMC 3, Bayonetta is an over-the-top Japanese bonanza that outdoes even DMC 3 in ridiculousness.
- Nier: Automota (Singleplayer)
    - A unique game featuring a few different game genres mashed into one, Nier: Automata is a fun Japanese action game.
- Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order (Singleplayer)
    - A Star Wars souls-like -- fun to explore and stunning graphics. Good for 20+ hours.

## Multiplayer FPS
- Doom 2016 & Doom Eternal (Single/Multiplayer)
    - I mean, it's Doom. Absolute blast to play, just fast-paced brutal action. RIP AND TEAR
- Counter-strike: Global Offensive (Multiplayer)
    - It's counter-strike. team-based multiplayer FPS. not my thing really
- Rainbow Six: Siege  (Multiplayer)
    - Great alternative to CS:GO. also not my thing
- Left 4 Dead 2 (Multiplayer)
    - i love killing zombies
- Overwatch (Multiplayer)
    - hero-based team deathmatch by Blizzard. i'm sure it's a blast)

## Sidescrolling platformers and Metroidvanias
- Hollow Knight (Singleplayer)
    - Unbelievably good. The story, the art, the gameplay -- it is one of the greatest metroidvanias of all time. I can't wait for the sequel, Silksong.
- Dead Cells (Singleplayer)
    - Combination of procedurally generated roguelike with a metroidvania. Death is permanent, but necessary -- every run gives you currency to purchase more and better weapons, which help you progress even farther. Great fun.
- Steamworld Dig 1 & 2 (Singleplayer)
    - Dig downwards and collect items and find secrets. Return to the surface for upgrades. Great way to kill 20 hours.
- Ori and the Blind Forest 1 & 2 (Singleplayer)
    - Gorgeous metroidvania. The art is sublime, and the gameplay is a good balance of difficult and satisfying.
- Celeste (Singleplayer)
    - A fun pixel-art metroidvania.
- Kingdom Two Crowns (Single/Multiplayer)
    - A side-scrolling RTS of sorts, you play as a monarch who leads a village. All you can do is collect money, run around and pay for things. But from that simple premise you get a relaxing and engaging experience. Guard yourself each night from the Greed, and each day recruit more to your village. The game mechanics are a bit obscure, but once you get it, it is very fun.

## Top-down action
- Hotline Miami 1 & 2 (Singleplayer)
    - Especially Hotline Miami 1, this was a groundbreaking game. 80's setting, wonderful music, super violent, top-down twitch action game. Mind-bending story.
- Katana Zero (Singleplayer)
    - Taking influence from Hotline Miami, it's a type of sidescrolling cyberpunk game with an assassin samurai.
- Hyper Light Drifter (Signleplayer)

## Couch Co-op & fun with friends
- Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime (Single/Multiplayer)
    - Up to four players control different parts of a single ship. It can be great fun, but would recommend at least 3 players for this one!
- Jamestown (Single/Multiplayer)
    - An excellent, modern top-down shmup with a fun setting of colonial America on Mars. Gets very difficult -- fun to play with friends.
- Portal 2 (Single/Multiplayer)
- Don't Starve Together (Single/Multiplayer)
- Overcooked 1 & 2 (Single/Multiplayer)

## Puzzle
- The Return of the Obra Dinn (Singleplayer)
    - One of my absolute favorites of 2018. Logical deduction game on a 19th century ship -- your job is to deduce how every sailor died by listening to and examining a the frozen moment in time of their death.
- The Room 1, 2 & 3 (Singleplayer)
    - You solve 3D puzzle boxes. Cooler than it sounds. Very visually engaging and a surprisingly good story
- Unheard (Singleplayer)
    - Logic deduction game -- Listen in on conversations happening throughout the building to piece together the story and answer a key question, such as who is the murderer
- The Witness (Singleplayer)
- The Talos Principle (Singleplayer)
- Baba is You (Singleplayer)
- The House of Da Vinci (Singleplayer)

## Horror
- Soma (Singleplayer)
    - Existential crisis at a thermal plant at the bottom of the ocean -- unbelievably good and terrifying -- this game gets 10/10 from me
- Outlast (Singleplayer)
    - The gold standard of disturbing, violent horror that takes place in an asylum.
- Observer (Singleplayer)
    - Cyberpunk horror -- great visuals and good performance by the protagonist
- Alien: Isolation (Singleplayer)
    - One of the best uses of the Alien IP, this game will make you shit your pants as the Alien hunts you
- World of Horror (Singleplayer)
    - Fun indie game with retro graphics inspired by Junji Ito & Cosmic Horror
- Little Nightmares (Singleplayer)
    - Not scary so much as unsettling and anxious, this game has you controlling a small person in a raincoat in the belly of a giant ship, where things want to kill you. The art direction in this game is supremely good. Great to watch someone else play.
