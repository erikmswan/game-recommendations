# Game recommendations:

## Story-driven first person:
- Bioshock Infinite (S. Unravel the secrets of a colonial America themed flying city. Story gets absolutely nuts.).
- Prey (S. Survive and discover secrets in a space station where aliens called "mimics" that can turn into any item in the environment hunt you.)
- Portal 2 (S/M. The classic first-person puzzle game, absolutely hilarious writing with the perennial character of GladOS and featuring Stephen Merchant as a sarcastic flying robot sidekick)
- Call of Cthulhu (S. Decent enough lovecraftian horror, choice-driven gameplay with light detective elements. Scratches that Cosmic Horror itch.)
- What Remains of Edith Finch (S. A wonderful experience, perfect for playing with a partner. This game was such a delight. There is no combat, just digging into the family of Edith Finch by exploring her childhood home and progressing through innovative story pieces. Very sad at parts.)
- The Vanishing of Ethan Carter

- The Room 1, 2 & 3 (S. Series -- you solve 3D puzzle boxes. Cooler than it sounds. Very visually engaging and a surprisingly good story)
